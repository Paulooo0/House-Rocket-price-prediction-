# Machine-Learning_Rokket-House

* Description

A Jupyter notebook project, thought I test a few machine learning methods, in addiction of the classic data analysis/modeling procedures.

* Tested Methods

I tested `Random Forest`, `Linear Regression`, `Ridge` and `Lasso`.
The linear regression, ridge and lasso performed around 65% of accuracy and the random forest reached 78%, I used a few hyperparameters in the random forest for didactic porpouses.
