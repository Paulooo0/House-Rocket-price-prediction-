## What was done

* Initially was a machine learning in `jupyter notebook` project using the `kc_house_data.csv` dataset, but after I wanted to make this uselfull more likely a real project. I make a file called `app.py`, which countains the `flask API`. I create a `HTML` file to construct the HTML skeleton, and a `CSS` file to decorate it.

## Tested methods

* I tested `Random Forest`, `Linear Regression`, `Ridge` and `Lasso`.
The linear regression, ridge and lasso performed around 56% of accuracy and the random forest reached 78%, I used a few hyperparameters in the random forest.

## How to run

* Install [all sources]https://github.com/Paulooo0/price-prediction) and run `app.py`. After running, open your browser and type in the search bar `localhost:5000`, the `pred_page.html` will be open, and you can use the price prediction algorithm.
